nstacart Market Basket Analysis
-----------------------

This competition gives customer orders over time, and the aim of this competition is to predict if existing customers will order the same products which they order previously. [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis).

The best model we have obtained during the competition was ensemble the top 4 best models we have with F1 score maximization of Public LB score 0.4056450 (Rank 110/2623 top4%) and Private LB score 0.4034573(Rank 189/2623 top8%).

Usage
-----------------------

* Switch to `code/feature` directory using `cd code/feature`
* Run all R and Python files except `combine_all_features.R` to generate new features. The features files are all parallel, so they can be run in any order.
* Run `combine_all_features.R` after run all other files in `code/feature`.(it is not necessary to run this file, combining features also can be customed in `model/lgbm.py`)
* Switch to `model` dirctory
* Run `lgbm.py`.
    * This will dirctly train the lgbm model without CV, and predict the probability of each products
* Run `F1 score max.py`.
    * This will select the reordered products for each customer by maximizing F1 score.(This script is mainly contributed by faron)
